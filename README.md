# Project Proposal

## Project 
Online Pawn Shop
## What and Why? 
This application will allow users to securely trade and sell their unwanted/used items. Currently, there are no mainstream online markets which allow users to trade their items with other users (ex: xbox for laptop). Further, the online pawn shop would provide sellers the opportunity of having their items appraised and purchased by the shop. This allows for effortless sales on the user end. Whether you would like to trade your old xbox for a laptop, or 

## For Whom? 
Our target market is anyone who wants to sell or trade their used items. Additionally, those searching for second hand products. 

## How?
From the perspective of the user, there are two main functions: (1) to sell their (used/unwanted) items directly to the shop (2) to trade their items with the shop. The user would be able to enter information (including a picture) of their product and have it appraised by the shop. If apporved the shop will either offer a list of tradable items, or a cash amount that the user can chose between.  
To ensure that there is not a significant disparity between the value of supply and demand, the app will keep track and make appraisles intelligently (eg. only offer trade options when users are selling significantly more than they are trading). For finances we reccomend using the stripe API. 

## Scope
Z_Team Developers will create the application that will include all necessary algorithms and data to provide users with a a marketplace to trade and sell their used items.
